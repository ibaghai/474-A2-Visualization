    <h1> A2: Seattle Airbnb listing data by Seattle neighborhood </h1>
    <p>This visualization is based on Seattle AirBnB listing data from openAirBNB. This data shows the average price of AirBnB listings for each
      Seattle neighborhood.
      This is done in three ways: the average overall price of a listing, the price for listings
        for private rooms, and the average price of listing for entire houses/apts.

        <div class="btn-group" data-toggle="buttons">
            <label class="btn btn-primary active">
        <input value="Combined_Average_Price" class="views" type="radio" name="options" id="option1" autocomplete="off" checked>Overall Average Price
    </label>
            <label class="btn btn-primary">
        <input value="Average_Price_of_Private_Room" type="radio" class="views" name="options" id="option2" autocomplete="off">Average Price for a Private Room
    </label>
            <label class="btn btn-primary">
        <input value="Average_Price_of_Entire_Home/Apt" type="radio" class="views" name="options" id="option3" autocomplete="off">Average Price of an Entire Home/Apt
    </label>
        </div>

            On your webpage, you must provide a detailed defense of your choice of visual encodings and control features.
            For your visual layout, describe why it is an optimal choice for expressing your data effectively (~ 1 paragraph).
            Then, for each controlling
            element, detail how it enables your user to ask different questions (~1 paragraph).
            You should include specific examples of insights you discovered through the use of these tools.

          For this dataset I chose to do a barchart for each neighborhood and its price on a common scale.
          I did this because users are able to easily percieve the relative distance and lenght of the bars and the price of listing
          based on the position of the bar relative to one another for each neighborhood against one another.
          This is one of the most effective ways for individuals to percieve comparisons.
          I incorporated control buttons so that the user can comapre the average price listing, the listing for private rooms,
          and the price for entire houses/apts. This allows the user to quickly determine how expensive a neighborhood is for airbnb
          but also how quickly they can determine if that stays true for an entire house or a private room.
          This also allows the user to quickly determine what is the best use case for them and their AirBnB needs. Are they trying to book
          an entire house they can quickly jump to that data or if they want to compare average prices for a private room they can jump to that.
          Or if they want they can just browse the trends for pricing for priving overall by neighborhood.
          The buttons allow for many different use cases quickly and easily while relying on the ability to percieve the data on a common scale
          relative to each neighborhood by comparing position length.
          Also because it is on a scale it may be difficult to determine the exact price per neighborhood which is why I added a hover over
          that provides the user with the exact price.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:120%";>
          For the overall price button the user can quickly determine which neighborhoods seem are in what price ranges.
          By clicking through the average price for a private room and for entire house/apt the user can see that there seems to be a high
          correlation for where neighborhoods are with regards to one another in all three categories. However, Magnolia sees a massive spike in the
          for an entire house/apt which seems to bring up its overall average price as well. It is also interesting that Downtown seems to command
          a large premium for individual rooms per night, but that doesn't hold true for an entire apt/house compared to other neighborhood nor
          correlate with its overall listing price average.
