    <h1> A2: Seattle Airbnb listing data by Seattle neighborhood </h1>
    <p style="font-size:120%";>This visualization is based on Seattle AirBnB listing data from openAirBNB. This data shows the average price of AirBnB listings for each
      Seattle neighborhood. The price reflects the average price per neighborhood per night in three ways.
      <strong>These three ways are: the average overall listing price, the price for listings
        for private rooms, and the average price of listings for entire houses/apts. </strong>
      </p>

        <div class="btn-group" data-toggle="buttons">
            <label class="btn btn-primary active">
        <input value="Combined_Average_Price" class="views" type="radio" name="options" id="option1" autocomplete="off" checked>Overall Average Price
    </label>
            <label class="btn btn-primary">
        <input value="Average_Price_of_Private_Room" type="radio" class="views" name="options" id="option2" autocomplete="off">Average Price for a Private Room
    </label>
            <label class="btn btn-primary">
        <input value="Average_Price_of_Entire_Home/Apt" type="radio" class="views" name="options" id="option3" autocomplete="off">Average Price of an Entire Home/Apt
    </label>

        <h2>Seattle AirBnB data </h2>

        <div id="vis"></div>

        <p style="font-size:120%";>
          For this dataset I chose to do a barchart for <strong>each neighborhood and its price on a common scale </strong>.
          I did this because user's are easily able percieve the differences of the length of the bars relative to one another and the price of listings
          based on the <strong>position of the bar relative to one another for each neighborhood against one another </strong>.
          This is one of the  <strong>most effective ways for individuals to percieve comparisons </strong>.
          I incorporated control buttons so that the user can comapre the average listing prices, the listing prices for private rooms,
          and the prices for entire houses/apts. This allows the user to quickly determine how expensive a neighborhood is for an AirBnB
          but also how quickly they can determine if that stays true for an entire house or a private room or if they want the prices for those use cases.
          This also allows the user to quickly determine what is the best use case for them and their AirBnB needs. If they are trying to book
          an entire house they can quickly jump to that data or if they want to compare average prices for a private room they can jump to that.
          Or if they want they can just browse the trends for pricing for overall prices by neighborhood.
          These buttons allow for many different use cases quickly and easily while relying on the <strong> ability to percieve the data on a common scale
          relative to each neighborhood by comparing position length </strong>.
          Also because it is on a scale it may be difficult to determine the exact average price per neighborhood which is why I added a hover over
          that provides the user with the exact price.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:120%";>
          For the overall price button the user can quickly determine which neighborhoods are in what price ranges.
          By clicking through the average price for a private room or for entire houses/apts the user can see that there seems to be a <strong> high
          correlation for the listing prices for neighborhoods relative to one another in all three categories </strong>. However, <strong> Magnolia </strong>sees a massive spike in the
          price for listings for entire houses/apts which seems to bring up its overall average price. It is also interesting that <strong> Downtown </strong> seems to command
          a large premium for individual rooms per night, but that <strong>doesn't hold true </strong> for an entire apts/houses compared to other neighborhood nor
          correlate with its overall listing price average.
